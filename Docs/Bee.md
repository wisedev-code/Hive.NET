## Bee Class Documentation

The `Bee` class represents individual worker bees within the hive system. Bees play a crucial role in the hive's operations, performing tasks assigned to them by the hive manager. While users do not directly interact with bee instances, understanding their purpose and functionality is essential for comprehending hive behavior and efficiency.

### Purpose:

Bees serve as the workforce within the hive, executing tasks assigned to them by the hive manager. They are responsible for processing work items, performing actions, and carrying out activities necessary for the hive's functioning. Each bee operates autonomously, contributing to the overall productivity and effectiveness of the hive.

### Functionality:

- **Task Execution:** Bees execute tasks assigned to them by the hive manager, including processing work items, performing actions, and completing assigned activities.
- **Autonomy:** Bees operate autonomously within the hive, making decisions based on the tasks assigned to them and the hive's current state.
- **Error Handling:** Bees handle errors and exceptions encountered during task execution, ensuring proper error management and reporting within the hive system.

### Incorporation in Hive:

Bees are integral components of the hive system, automatically created and managed by the hive manager. Upon initialization of the hive, bees are generated based on the specified swarm size parameter, ensuring an adequate workforce for hive operations. Once created, bees contribute to task execution and overall hive functionality, working collaboratively to achieve hive objectives and goals.
